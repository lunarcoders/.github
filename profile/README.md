## 🌍 Who We Are

Lunar Coders is a small, specialized team working between **Europe and Asia**.  
We help companies take products built for one market and make them work globally, not with fluff, but with solid engineering and an understanding of how different regions actually behave.

No bloated stacks, no slow builds, no “enterprise complexity” for the sake of it.  
Just fast, scalable, international-ready systems.

## 🚀 What We Build

### **High-Performance Web Development**
React • Vite • Tailwind • TypeScript • PWAs • Edge deployments  
Optimized for speed and reliability, not hype.

### **Global Expansion & Localization**
Real multilingual support (EN/ES/PT/FR/DE/ZH/JP/AR, etc.)  
Hreflang, RTL, cultural adjustment done properly.

### **International SEO**
Technical SEO, Core Web Vitals, indexing, schema, CDN-level optimization.  
We focus on what actually moves the needle.

### **Brand & Market Adaptation**
Helping companies  especially from **Asia** positioning themselves clearly in Western markets.

## 🌐 Why We Exist

A lot of great products stay stuck locally because the technical side and the cultural side don’t line up.  
We solve that gap by mixing:

- Western UX standards  
- Eastern precision  
- Clean engineering  
- Market awareness  

The outcome is simple:  
Products that feel natural in any region.
